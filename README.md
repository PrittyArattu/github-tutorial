FCOR599 Project - Individual Tree Segmentation 

* Reliable information on forest dynamics, including information on how individual trees grow,

compete, and die, is essential for modern forest management and carbon accounting. In recent years, data obtained from airborne laser scanning (ALS) have increasingly been used for understanding changes in forest stands over time at the stand- and individual tree level.
